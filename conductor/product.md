# Initial Concept\nManage personal Home Manager environment on macOS (darwin) with Nix, including dev environments (Python, Rust, Dart, Kotlin) and shell configurations (Zsh, Starship).
# Project Guide: Home Manager & Darwin Nix Configuration\n\n## Vision\nA unified system and user environment management for macOS using Nix, providing a seamless bridge between OS settings (nix-darwin) and user-level dotfiles (home-manager).\n\n## Target Users\n- **Daehyeok (Self):** Primary user on macOS (darwin) who values a reproducible, clean, and highly portable development setup.\n\n## Key Goals\n- **Full System & User Integration:** Leverage both nix-darwin and Home Manager to control everything from system defaults to shell aliases in one place.\n- **CLI-Centric & Minimalist:** Prioritize lightweight, efficient command-line tools and a distraction-free environment.\n- **Bleeding Edge Reproducibility:** Use the Nix Unstable channel to ensure access to the latest software versions while maintaining a consistent configuration.\n\n## Core Features\n- **Rapid Dev Environment Setup:** Instant setup for Python, Rust, Dart, and Kotlin development through Nix modules.\n- **Unified Shell Experience:** Consistent Zsh, Starship, and vterm configurations across all terminals.\n- **Clean, Modular Architecture:** A highly readable configuration structure that separates programs, services, and system settings.\n\n## Success Metrics\n- **Reproducibility:** A single `nix build` or `darwin-rebuild` command fully restores the environment on a new macOS machine.\n- **Speed:** Minimal shell startup time and low overhead for development tools.\n- **Cleanliness:** Zero manual configuration outside of the Nix store.
